# Movie-Recommender
Developed a basic movie recommendation system that suggests movies most similar to a user's selected movie by leveraging correlation-based similarity metrics.
This system computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between user ratings of different movies to identify those with the most similar viewing patterns, thereby recommending movies that are likely to align with the user's preferences.
